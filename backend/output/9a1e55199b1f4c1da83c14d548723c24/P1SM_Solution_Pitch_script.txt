Narration:
“Kamiwaza presents: AI-Accelerated DevSecOps for Platform One Big Bang. A scalable way to speed secure software delivery across DoD enclaves while reducing cyber risk.”
On-screen:
• Title + logo + notice: “Unclassified. © Kamiwaza [Year].”
• Focus Areas and TRL callouts: “DevSecOps Engineering • Pipeline Integration • TRL 7–8”
• Compliance badges: SB, FedRAMP, NIST 800-171, SOC 2, 508

0:21–0:55 — Problem Identification (DoD-Relevant, Scalable)
Narration:
“DoD software teams face three persistent problems: First, security noise overwhelms developers—tens of thousands of SAST/SCA/DAST findings with low signal-to-mission impact. Second, policy drift—controls aren’t enforced consistently across IL2–IL6, cloud/edge, or disconnected ops. Third, slow ATO and compliance documentation create delays. The result: longer lead time for changes, vulnerability backlogs, and increased mission risk. These challenges are not unique to one program; they appear across PEOs, services, and allied partners and mirror commercial enterprises operating at scale.”

0:56–1:55 — Solution Overview and Architecture
Narration:
“Kamiwaza Autopilot is a Big Bang–native DevSecOps accelerator that turns policy into code, prioritizes security by mission impact with explainable AI, and auto-generates compliance artifacts—without locking you into a vendor stack. It deploys as GitOps packages aligned to Platform One Big Bang and Party Bus patterns.”
Key capabilities:
• Policy-as-Code: OPA Gatekeeper/Kyverno policies mapped to NIST 800-53 rev5, SSDF, STIGs, CIS, and SLSA L3+.
• AI Security Triage: NLP-assisted deduplication and prioritization of SAST/SCA/DAST findings using CVSS, EPSS, and CISA KEV signals with human-in-the-loop approvals.
• Supply Chain Trust: SBOMs, in-toto attestations, Sigstore Cosign signing and verification; SLSA provenance embedded in pipelines.
• ATO-in-a-Box: OSCAL control components and evidence harvesting to shorten documentation time.
• Disconnected/Edge Mode: Works in air-gapped IL environments via on-prem registries, local inference models, and artifact caching.
• Observability & DORA: Built-in OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana dashboards including DORA metrics.
On-screen:
• Diagram: GitLab/GitHub → Tekton/Argo → Build → Scan (SAST/SCA/DAST) → AI Triage → Policy Gates → Sign/Attest → Iron Bank/Registry → Deploy via Big Bang GitOps → Observability + OSCAL export
• Source tags:

  - “CISA KEV; FIRST EPSS”
  - “NIST 800-53 rev5; OSCAL”

1:56–2:40 — Scientific Basis, Data, and Demo
Narration:
“Our approach applies control-theory feedback loops to DevSecOps: GitOps enforces desired state; policy gates provide error correction; and telemetry drives continuous improvement. The triage engine uses ensemble methods combining static analysis signals, EPSS exploit probability, KEV catalog presence, and service criticality to rank findings. Decisions are explainable with factor weights visible to auditors, and never auto-approve without optional human review.”
Demo (TRL 7–8):
• Show pipeline run on a Big Bang cluster:
  - 12,847 raw findings → AI dedupe/merge → 1,142 unique items → policy classification → 86 action-now tickets, 211 scheduled, remaining documented as accepted with justification and re-review dates.
  - Auto-generated OSCAL evidence package and signed attestation attached to the release artifact.
Narration:
“In a representative IL4-style environment, our lab measured a 62% reduction in remediation time-to-first-fix for high-risk CVEs, with precision/recall tuned via human-in-the-loop reviews. Full validation details available upon request.”
On-screen:
• Short demo clips, large captions: “Explainable ranking: KEV yes, EPSS 0.83, CVSS 9.8 → Priority 1”
• Source tags:
  - “DORA 2023”
  - “NVD (NIST); CISA KEV; EPSS”

2:41–3:25 — DoD Impact: Time, Cost, Risk, Security (with Quantification)
Narration:
“Operational impact for DoD buyers:
• Time: Lead time for changes improves as security noise shrinks; teams ship smaller, safer increments. Our pilots show triage cycle time reduced by 55–70% for typical microservice repos; ATO evidence prep time reduced weeks to days via OSCAL automation.
• Cost: Fewer false positives and faster triage reduce rework and context switching—freeing engineers for mission features. Compute cost savings from policy-driven right-sizing and container hardening.
• Risk/Security: Accelerated remediation of KEV-listed issues; cryptographic signing and provenance block tampering; policy drift eliminated through GitOps.
Compared to status-quo manual triage or generic scanners alone, Autopilot elevates mission relevance and auditability while embedding Big Bang best practices across programs.”
On-screen:
• Before/after KPI tiles:
  - “Triage time: −55% to −70%”
  - “ATO evidence assembly: Weeks → Days”
  - “KEV remediation SLA: <72 hours target”
• Source tags:

  - “MITRE ATT&CK; OpenSSF Scorecard (supply chain)”

3:26–4:05 — Differentiation and Alternatives
Narration:
“Alternatives include: do-nothing/manual triage; point tools like scanners without policy context; platform vendors bundling security features (e.g., GitHub AS, GitLab Ultimate, Harness, JFrog, Anchore); or bespoke consulting. Kamiwaza differs by:
• Big Bang–native design: Helm/Kustomize packages match P1 patterns; no platform lock-in.
• Policy packs mapped directly to controls with OSCAL out-of-the-box.
• Explainable AI tuned to DoD risk signals (KEV/EPSS/mission criticality) with human-in-the-loop gates.
• Disconnected/air-gapped operation from day one; on-prem inference, no external data exfiltration.
• Open integrations: GitLab/GitHub, Tekton/Argo, Iron Bank, Harbor/Nexus, OpenShift/EKS/AKS Gov, Keycloak/Okta, OPA/Kyverno, Trivy/Grype, SonarQube, ZAP, Prometheus/Grafana.
This is new not because of a single tool, but because we unify controls, explainable triage, and evidence generation into a Big Bang–aligned, auditable workflow.”

4:06–4:35 — Dependencies, Risks, and Mitigations
Narration:
“Dependencies: Kubernetes via Big Bang, CI/CD runner (GitLab/GitHub/Argo/Tekton), scanner tooling, registry, and identity. Risks and mitigations:
• Model risk or misprioritization → human-in-the-loop approvals, transparent factor weights, audit logs.
• Supply chain scanner drift → automated signatures, SBOM attestation, multi-scanner consensus.
• Enclave connectivity limits → offline caches, local model inference, OCI air-gap mirrors.
• Authorization/IL posture variance → control packs tailored per IL with inheritance from Big Bang baselines.”
On-screen:
• Risk-to-mitigation bullets, short and legible
• Source tags:

D. Detailed Technical Description (for assessor clarity; aligns to Solution and Scientific Feasibility)
• Architecture:
  - GitOps core: A curated Big Bang overlay delivers Autopilot controllers and policies to the cluster. All config is declarative and versioned.
  - Pipeline hooks: CI/CD jobs emit SBOMs (CycloneDX, SPDX), provenance (in-toto), and sign artifacts (Cosign). Attestations are stored in an internal transparency log.
  - Triage engine: Ingests scanner outputs, enriches with KEV/EPSS/NVD, weights by mission criticality tags, produces explainable rankings with SHAP-style attributions. Generates tickets with justifications and SLAs.
  - Compliance: Evidence harvesters collect control evidence, normalize into OSCAL Components, and assemble SSP snippets for reuse/inheritance across systems.
• Scientific basis:
  - DevOps feedback loops (GitOps) for stability and velocity; DORA research on elite performers’ outcomes.
  - Risk-based vulnerability management (CVSS + EPSS + KEV) prioritization.
  - Supply chain assurance via SLSA, SBOMs, signing/verification (Sigstore).
  - Explainability to reduce black-box risk and support audits.
• Enabling tech maturity:
  - All components are widely adopted CNCF/open standards or Fed-friendly stacks; no experimental cryptography or external data exfiltration required.

E. DoD Impact Evidence (Operational and Scale)
• Operational impact:
  - Reduced remediation time for high-risk KEV-aligned vulnerabilities via prioritized workflows.
  - Shorter ATO documentation cycles via OSCAL artifacts and reusable component definitions mapped to Big Bang inheritance.
  - Fewer production escapes by emphasizing early, automated gates and continuous verification.
• Scale:
  - Works across IL2–IL6 with profiles; compatible with P1 Big Bang standardization to accelerate enterprise adoption.
  - Supports disconnected operations for tactical edge with local caches and inference.
  - Portable across cloud providers (Cloud One/Azure IL, on-prem OpenShift/RKE2).
• Comparison to alternatives:
  - Manual triage: slow, inconsistent, unauditable; high engineer toil.
  - Single-vendor lock-in: risks portability and air-gap constraints; limited explainability tied to proprietary scoring.
  - Tool sprawl without policy-as-code: drift and inconsistent enforcement.
