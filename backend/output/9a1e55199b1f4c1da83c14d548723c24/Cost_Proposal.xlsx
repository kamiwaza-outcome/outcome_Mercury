- CLIN structure aligns to SF-1449: CLIN 0001 covers all services and non-media ODCs; CLIN 0002 covers pass-through media.
- Media plan is illustrative; final channel mix will be COR-approved and optimized monthly to meet KPIs.
- All labor rates are fully burdened (inclusive of overhead and reasonable profit); no separate fee is added.
- We will track all media invoices and provide post-buy analyses monthly, including reach, frequency, CPM, GRPs, and digital KPIs.
