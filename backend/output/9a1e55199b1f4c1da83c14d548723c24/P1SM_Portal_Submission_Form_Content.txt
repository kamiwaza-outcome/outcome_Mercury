AI-Accelerated DevSecOps for Platform One Big Bang: Secure CI/CD at DoD Scale

15) Abstract Description (≤ 1,500 characters; Marketplace listing; no proprietary/CUI)
AI-Accelerated DevSecOps for Platform One Big Bang delivers secure CI/CD at DoD scale. We provide pre-integrated pipelines, IaC/CaC blueprints, and policy-as-code aligned to P1 Big Bang, the DoD DevSecOps Reference Design, and Zero Trust. Our AI triages SAST/DAST/SCA findings, prioritizes vulnerabilities by mission impact, and generates remediation pull requests and SBOMs. Built-in gates enforce RMF controls, STIG/CIS baselines, container hardening, and license governance. Integrations cover Kubernetes (K8s), GitLab/GitHub, artifact registries, Anchore/Trivy, and ticketing/ITSM. Typical outcomes include faster lead time for changes, reduced defect escape, and accelerated ATO via automated evidence and control attestation.

TRL 7: prototypes demonstrated in operational government environments; deployable across IL2–IL6 and at the edge. We are a U.S. Small Business and the original developer. Security posture: NIST SP 800-171 compliant; SOC 2 Type II; HIPAA; Section 508; FedRAMP Moderate Authorized (managed service option). Pricing is modular: annual subscription for software/managed pipeline plus optional implementation, training, and sustainment services; public pricing model available on our website. Contracting is rapid via this CSO; follow-on awards can use FAR Part 35, OT/Prototype, or production as appropriate.
