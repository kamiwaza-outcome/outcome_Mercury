Technical Proposal
Multimedia Marketing Strategy for America 250 — RFP No. 19BA3025R0003 (PR15563218)
Department of State, U.S. Embassy Manama, Kingdom of Bahrain

1) Executive Summary and Understanding
Kamiwaza proposes a turnkey, bilingual (Arabic/English), one-year multimedia campaign in Bahrain to localize and amplify the Department of State’s America 250 brand. Our approach is optimized for an LPTA environment: we deliver a complete, compliant, and efficient solution that meets all technical requirements while prioritizing value-for-money, speed-to-launch, and rigorous measurement.

We will:
- Localize America 250 branding for Bahraini audiences with Embassy approval.
- Conduct rapid pre-campaign research (focus groups and social listening) to refine target segments and messages.
- Design a December 2025–July 2026 activation strategy, integrated with Bahrain’s cultural calendar and the Embassy’s Independence Day celebration.
- Execute data-driven media planning and buying across traditional, digital, and emerging channels with performance guarantees, make-goods, and added value.
- Produce bilingual, culturally informed creative assets and a signature multimedia display for the Embassy’s official Independence Day event.
- Provide monthly status reports, industry-standard metrics, and post-buy analyses via secure dashboards and documented deliverables.
- Manage the program through a disciplined PMO with a Quality Assurance Plan, database integrity controls, financial reporting, subcontractor governance, and a transition plan.

Ambiguous dates noted in the RFP are addressed by assuming a late September 2025 contract start, planning in Sep–Nov 2025, launch in December 2025, and performance through September 2026 (inclusive of July Independence Day). We will confirm final milestones at the post-award conference.

2) Branding and Localization (IV.1; IV.1.1)
- Brand stewardship: We will adopt DoS America 250 brand assets and localize for Bahrain without altering core identity. Localization will include Arabic typography, culturally resonant photography, and Bahrain-specific references, vetted by the Embassy.
