Below is a complete, Section L/M-ready pricing workbook specification you can paste into Excel to create Cost_Proposal.xlsx. It provides a detailed, defensible cost breakdown structure with formulas and placeholders. Because the actual RFP content for SAM.gov notice_id 710637f47916457280ca93dbb73c2b41 is not yet available, this is a compliant template with example data and clear instructions on where to insert the real CLINs, periods of performance, and rates. Replace all example data with final inputs once you retrieve the solicitation and attachments.

Instructions
- Create a new Excel file named Cost_Proposal.xlsx.
- Create sheets exactly as named below (case-sensitive). For each sheet, copy the corresponding CSV block (including the first header line) and paste into cell A1.
- Do not finalize numbers or submit until RFP specifics are verified. All example numbers are placeholders to illustrate structure and formulas.

Note: Adjust the mapping logic in Hours to align with your final WBS-to-CLIN mapping. For multi-year pricing, duplicate rows per period and swap the Loaded Rate column to the correct year (I:Y columns in Labor_Rates) or use INDEX with a period-to-column mapping.

How this model aligns with federal pricing expectations
- Traceability: WBS to CLIN mapping and BOE line-by-line supports auditability and evaluation consistency with Section L/M.
- Contract type flexibility: Loaded labor rates support FFP and T&M. If CPFF, switch Loaded_Rate computation by removing profit from the rate and adding Fee on Total Cost base at the CLIN or total level per the RFP.
- Indirect transparency: Fringe, OH, G&A, handling, and fee are explicit and adjustable to match disclosed forward-pricing rates. If you have DCAA-approved rates, replace placeholders and lock the Indirect_Rates sheet.
- Escalation: Annual labor escalation is parameterized (default 3%). Align to solicitation guidance or cite BLS ECI.
- ODC/SubK allowability: The template treats ODC/SubK with handling, G&A, and fee per standard practice; adjust if the RFP limits fee on pass-through or prohibits burdening certain ODCs.
- Small Business utilization: SB_Participation calculates planned percentages by dollar to meet or exceed agency goals once Subcontractors are finalized.

Where to highlight Kamiwaza’s competitive advantages in the price volume
- Transition-in efficiency: Lower transition LOE and reduced startup costs (ReadMe, BOE 1.1).
- AI acceleration: Apply explicit productivity factors in BOE (e.g., 20–30% reduction in data pipeline build hours), with conservative phasing to support cost realism.
- 24/7 US-based support: Price a predictable, risk-reducing support CLIN (Cloud Platform Ops), demonstrating value and continuity.
- Cost competitiveness: Reflect target “~20% below industry rates” either via lower direct wages (supported by salary survey data) or via disclosed “Strategic Discount” line at the CLIN or Grand Total level if permitted.
- Zero security incidents: Reduce risk reserves and rework contingencies; articulate in BOE notes.

Next steps to finalize
- Retrieve the SAM.gov notice (ID 710637f47916457280ca93dbb73c2b41) and all attachments.
- Confirm: solicitation type, CLIN structure, contract type, periods of performance, file naming, and whether the agency provides a mandatory pricing template.
- Replace placeholders:
  - Indirect_Rates with actual provisional/budgeted rates and fee policy.
  - Labor_Rates with actual base wages and work locations; confirm any locality pay or CBA wage determinations.
  - Staffing_Plan LOE per PWS tasks and required SLAs.
  - CLIN_Mapping per Section B or Attachment J.XX.
  - ODC_Travel and Subcontractors with vendor quotes and GSA per diem rates.
- Run internal reviews:
  - Cost realism: sanity-check LOE versus scope and risks.
  - Arithmetic check: confirm roll-ups equal across CLIN_Detail and Summary_Price.
  - Compliance check: confirm if fee may be applied to ODC/SubK and if any caps exist.

If you provide the solicitation package, I will immediately tailor this workbook: import the actual CLIN list, reflect the required contract type math, set periods, and deliver the final Cost_Proposal.xlsx ready for submission.
