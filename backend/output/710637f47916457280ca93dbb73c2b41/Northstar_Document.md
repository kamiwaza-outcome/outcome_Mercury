1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- Solicitation type: Sources Sought / Request for Information (RFI). This is market research, not a Request for Proposal. There is no award from this notice; responses are used to assess industry capabilities, shape the acquisition strategy, refine the SOW, select contract vehicle, and decide set‑aside strategy. Our response should be a concise, compliance‑forward capability package tailored to the stated scope and any instructions in the RFI attachment; it should not include pricing. Primary goals: demonstrate relevant technical capability, security eligibility (TS/SCI, US‑only), ability to perform at government sites, and past performance in similar RF/ISR automation.

- Questions: Not specified; if needed, email Contracting Officer; do not contact Ombudsman for clarifications.

7. CRITICAL COMPLIANCE ITEMS
- US citizens only may perform under this effort. Confidence: 9
- Ability to obtain and use CACs for on‑site work. Confidence: 9
- Access up to TS/SCI; implies personnel clearance eligibility and classified handling experience at Government facilities. Confidence: 8
- Foreign participation excluded at prime contractor level (foreign primes prohibited). Confidence: 10
- NAICS 541715 alignment; be prepared to state business size. Confidence: 10
- Mandatory forms/certifications: None specified for the RFI stage. Future solicitation may include standard FAR/DFARS clauses, reps/certs, and security accreditation requirements. Confidence: 6
- Security clearances/facility: Facility clearance is not explicitly required in the notice; likely beneficial. Confidence: 6

8. DOCUMENT GENERATION STRATEGY
Given the RFI/Sources Sought nature and the presence of an RFI attachment plus a Draft SOW, generate a concise, targeted capability package that maps directly to SOW elements and the explicit constraints.
- Documents to create now:
  - Cover letter (1 page): Compliance, summary of fit, contact info, and acknowledgment this is an RFI response.
  - Capability statement (primary document): Address each Draft SOW topic thread with evidence and relevance to ISR mission; include mapping table to SOW tasks.
  - Past performance annex (2–3 pages): Focus on RF/ISR/AI programs with outcomes.
  - Security posture statement (1–2 pages): US‑citizen staffing, clearance status/eligibility, CAC onboarding, classified execution experience.
  - Staffing and key personnel briefs (short bios; no resumes unless requested): Highlight RF ML, DSP, EW, cloud/edge, DevSecOps.
  - Quad chart (optional but powerful): Problem, solution, differentiation, proof points.
  - Company data sheet: UEI, CAGE, NAICS, size, locations, primes/subs interest.
- Organization logic:
  - Main capability statement includes executive summary, technical capabilities by SOW area, operational readiness (on‑site/TS/SCI), transition plan and 5–7 year roadmap, and SOW/requirements trace matrix.
  - Appendices hold detailed past performance and bios to preserve readability if page limits allow.
- Confidence score for this organization: 7 (pending review of RFI attachment’s specific instructions).

9. REQUIREMENT-TO-DOCUMENT MAPPING
- Email submission by deadline; addresses provided
  - Target: Cover letter and email body; footer on all documents with Notice ID and date.
- US citizens only; CACs; work at Government facilities; TS/SCI access
  - Target: Security posture statement; Operational readiness section in capability statement.
- RF spectral characterization capability
  - Target: Capability statement – Technical section “RF Spectral Characterization” with evidence, algorithms, toolchains, lab/field results.
- Automated M2M signal processing for ISR
  - Target: Capability statement – “Automated M2M ISR Processing” with architecture diagrams, data flows, ML ops.
- Relevance to tactical and strategic ISR
  - Target: Capability statement – Mission use cases and past performance vignettes.
- Long-term R&D horizon (5–7 years), CPFF readiness
  - Target: Capability statement – Program management approach and scalable staffing; Business readiness paragraph.
- NAICS/PSC alignment; business size
  - Target: Company data sheet; Cover letter.
- Foreign participation exclusion at prime
  - Target: Cover letter affirmation; Security posture statement.
- SOW coverage
  - Target: SOW Traceability Matrix in capability statement mapping our capabilities to each Draft SOW task; flag gaps and proposed partners.

Dependencies and potential overlaps:
- Security posture ties directly to on‑site performance and TS/SCI tasks; ensure consistency across documents.
- Past performance examples should align with each SOW area referenced in the trace matrix.
- Key personnel bios must match the skills claimed in technical sections.

10. AMBIGUITY FLAGS & ASSUMPTIONS
Ambiguities/unknowns requiring clarification or attachment review:
- Exact response content, page limits, and formatting are not specified on the SAM page. The RFI attachment likely provides these. Confidence: 9
- Whether facility clearance (FCL) at the prime is required for this phase or later; where classified work will be performed (government SCIF only vs contractor SCIF). Confidence: 6
- Whether foreign subcontractor participation is permitted (only prime exclusion is stated). Confidence: 5
- Desired contract vehicle(s) or preference for OTA vs FAR‑based awards. Confidence: 5
- Any small business goals or set‑aside intent. Confidence: 6
- Data rights/ IP expectations and export control constraints. Confidence: 5
- Any ROM/pricing info requested (not typical for RFI; assume not needed unless stated). Confidence: 7
- Submission email subject line, file naming conventions, and maximum attachment size. Confidence: 5
- On‑site “other locations” scope (OCONUS?) and travel clearances. Confidence: 5

Assumptions we will operate under unless the RFI attachment states otherwise:
- No pricing required; qualitative capability response only.
- Single consolidated capability package (PDF) with optional appendices; keep under 10 pages unless otherwise directed.
- File formats PDF/DOCX accepted; filenames include Notice ID and company name.
- Classified information must not be included in the response; unclassified only.
- We can express interest as prime and/or subcontractor; we will state US‑only prime compliance.

Overall confidence in interpretation: 7 (strong alignment with typical AFRL RFI patterns; pending verification of specifics inside the RFI-Narwhal Red.docx attachment).

Kamiwaza‑specific positioning guidance
- Emphasize AI/ML automation for RF: spectral sensing, emitter detection/classification, adaptive learning, edge inference; highlight cloud‑edge integration and MLOps in secure DoD environments.
- Show experience integrating with ISR systems and data pipelines; cite prior federal engagements.
- Underscore readiness for on‑site execution at government facilities, CAC processes, and work on programs up to TS/SCI (without including classified details).
- Provide a pragmatic 5–7 year roadmap illustrating research progression, maturation (TRL advancement), and transition to operations.
- Offer to support as prime (US‑only) and to team with specialized RF hardware/EW partners to cover any hardware or flight test gaps.

Be extremely thorough checklist (to finalize once attachments are reviewed)
- Confirm and list every explicit response item from RFI-Narwhal Red.docx (questions to answer, data fields, page limits).
- Build a SOW traceability matrix covering each Draft SOW task with Kamiwaza capability, past performance, and evidence.
- Affirm compliance statements: US‑citizen staffing, prime foreign exclusion, TS/SCI access capability, on‑site performance readiness, CAC onboarding.
- Validate NAICS 541715 size status and include UEI/CAGE.
- Ensure submission timing (12 pm EDT Sep 18, 2025), both POCs on email, subject line includes Notice ID, and attachments within email size limits.
- Keep response unclassified; include distribution statements as appropriate (e.g., “Distribution Statement A” if required by RFI).
