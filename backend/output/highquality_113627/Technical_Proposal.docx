Kamiwaza Technologies
RFP No. 19BA3025R0003 — Multimedia Marketing Strategy for America 250
Volume II — Technical

1. Executive Summary and Understanding
Kamiwaza Technologies proposes a fast, compliant, and locally grounded solution to plan, produce, buy, and measure a year-long, bilingual America 250 campaign in the Kingdom of Bahrain. We will leverage:
- A Bahrain-ready team through our Gulf presence and teaming with Al-Mamlaka Creative (Manama-based), enabling immediate mobilization, Arabic/English transcreation, and local media relationships.
- Our ISO 9001-certified delivery model and KamiInsights AI platform to accelerate audience research, optimize media efficiency, and deliver transparent, standards-based reporting (GRPs, CPM, audited circulation/ratings, CTR, VTR, dwell time) with post-buy analyses and make-goods.
- An integrated implementation approach that balances traditional, digital, and on-the-ground activations tailored for Bahrain, culminating in a high-quality multimedia display at the Embassy’s 2026 Independence Day celebration.

We will strictly use Embassy-provided America 250 branding, localized for Bahrain audiences upon COR approval, and comply with all clauses (e.g., 52.204-25, 52.204-27, DOSAR 652.228-71). Our technical solution is purpose-built to meet LPTA: complete, compliant, and cost-efficient.

2. Assumptions and Clarifications
- Period of Performance (PoP): We assume late September 2025 through late September 2026. We will initiate planning immediately upon award, target a December 2025 public launch, and run through July 2026 to include Independence Day, with closeout and transition by September 2026. We will confirm final PoP and launch dates with the CO/COR at the post-award conference.
- Branding assets: America 250 brand guidelines/assets will be provided post-award; we will propose localized guidance for Embassy approval.
- TikTok/ByteDance (FAR 52.204-27): We will not install or use a ByteDance covered application on any IT used in performance. Our plan does not rely on TikTok. If the Embassy later authorizes third-party placements, we will execute in compliance without installing the application.
- Service scope: All work in English and Arabic; in-country activation in Bahrain with regional production support as needed.

3. Technical Solution Architecture
3.1 Functional Architecture
- Research and Insights Layer
  - Primary: Embassy-approved focus groups (Arabic/English), stakeholder interviews, in-field intercepts.
  - Secondary: Social listening (Arabic/English), media consumption panels, desk research on U.S.–Bahrain perceptions.
- Creative and Production Layer
  - Bilingual creative studio, 4K/8K field production, motion graphics, AR elements as appropriate, print and OOH production, Embassy approval workflows.
- Media Planning and Buying Layer
  - Integrated plans across TV/radio/print/OOH/digital/social, with negotiated performance guarantees, added value, and formal make-good provisions.
- Activation and Outreach Layer
  - Community partnerships, Embassy event amplification, influencer collaborations with strict brand safety and disclosure, physical installations in public venues per permitting.
- Measurement and Reporting Layer
  - Standard metrics (reach, frequency, GRPs, CPM, audited circulation/ratings).
  - Digital metrics (impressions, CTR, VTR, CVR, site visits, time on site, link-offs, leads).
  - Post-buy analyses and guarantee tracking; monthly dashboards and written status reports.

3.2 Data and Systems Architecture
- Data Ingestion: KamiInsights connectors ingest from ad servers, DSPs, social APIs (Meta, X, Snapchat, YouTube), Google Analytics 4, CRM/email platforms, and third-party verification (IAS/Moat where available).
- Storage and Processing: Secure data lake with role-based access control; encryption in transit and at rest; audit logs; data quality checks. Default hosting in AWS Middle East (Bahrain) region (me-south-1); option to host in U.S. regions if directed.
- Analytics and Visualization: KPI models for reach/GRPs, frequency capping analysis, attribution heuristics (last-touch and position-based), creative performance scoring, and media mix optimization. Dashboards via KamiInsights web portal; exports to Embassy-preferred formats (PowerPoint/PDF).
- Security and Compliance: ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type II, NIST 800-171 aligned controls. No TikTok/ByteDance installations (52.204-27); no covered telecom (52.204-25). PII minimized; if handled, privacy training per 52.224-3; DOSAR 652.239-71 controls applied as applicable.
- Content and Asset Management: Versioned media asset management with metadata, rights tracking, and Embassy approval gates. Backup and disaster recovery with daily snapshots and weekly offsite redundancy.

4. Branding and Localization (IV.1, IV.1.1)
- Approach
  - Apply America 250 identity consistently; propose Bahrain-localized extensions (Arabic typography pairings, culturally appropriate color harmonies) for Embassy approval.
  - Build a bilingual style guide addendum covering tone, transcreation rules, and cultural sensitivity guardrails.
- Pre-Campaign Assessment
  - Focus Groups: Minimum 6 sessions segmented by youth (18–25), families, educators, and entrepreneurs, with gender balance; stimuli derived from America 250 narratives and U.S.–Bahrain milestones.
  - Target Audience Identification: Cluster audiences by psychographics (e.g., future-focused youth, heritage-seeking families, opportunity-oriented SMEs), preferred media habits, and language preference.
- Deliverables
  - Research Plan and Protocols (English/Arabic)
  - Audience Definition Report with personas and media indices
